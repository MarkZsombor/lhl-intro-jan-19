# W1D2
Welcome to the second day of the first week! Now with your new-found knowledge into the world of HTML, you're on your way to creating anything you can think of.

## Front End Ecosystem
We started off by digging into all the parts that make up a website.

- HTML -- The structure (semantic language)
- CSS -- Style / look / feel (rule based language)
- JavaScript -- Behaviour / functionality (event based language)

## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
It's the most basic building block of the web and includes elements like: `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, `<main>`, `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`, `<li>`, `<img>`. The ***semantic*** tags control what to display and help you organize the document meaningfully.

### The Structure
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```
The head defines rules for the page, this is where you put your `<title>` element and `<link>` your CSS stylesheet. The body is where everything visible goes. This is where most of your content lies.

## Anatomy of a tag
Elements are generally made up of an opening tag, content and a closing tag (with the exception of self closing tags. There's always exceptions). Together they form an element. When elements are positioned within another element, it's called nesting. Nesting is easier to manage when you indent your tags (2 or 4 spaces). There are block-level elements (occupies the entire space) and inline elements (does not start on a new line).

Attributes give tags more meaning / information and always follow the same pattern.
`attribute="value"`

e.g. `<a href="https://lighthouselabs.ca">Take me to Lighthouse Labs</a>`
